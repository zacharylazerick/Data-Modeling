    "# Handout 7 Experiments in k-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Before break we had a Pythonless lecture on k-Means clustering. Here we'll dig into \n",
    "the naive/intuitive algorithm and run several experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is implemented in the Python script *cluster_k-means.py*, which is posted\n",
    "in Canvas. You should download the script and place it in your class folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "There three Exploration questions below. Briefly write up your observations, insert them \n",
    "below, and submit them in Canvas by 3/20.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script has two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### PART 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   (0)  The user chooses K, the initial number of normal distributions, and k, the number of \n",
    "        clusters being computed. \n",
    "        \n",
    "   (i)  The script generates K clusters of normally distributed points. The script chooses means\n",
    "        standard deviations, and numbers of points for the clusters randomly. However, these\n",
    "        could be assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (ii)  It combines/concatenates the K np.arrays into a single two column array of length N.\n",
    "        It also creates a list of indices, indicating the group number a point is assigned to.\n",
    "\n",
    " (iii)  It plots and colors the points according to their initial pre-assigned groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### PART 2\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data produced in PART 1 (or a data set provided by the user) and called \"points\" in the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "   (iv) Randomly chooses k of the points to be the initial means.\n",
    "\n",
    "   (v)  Applies the intuitive k-means clustering algorithm for the user defined k\n",
    "\n",
    "  (vi)  Plots and colors the points according to the computed optimal clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "   (vii) Prints the number of points that are re-assigned at each step of the \n",
    "         algorithm and ends with 0 re-assigned points when the solution is \n",
    "         attained, i.e. points are no longerby the algorithm\n",

Also, as k increases, the number of iterations for the program to terminate (i.e. times the while loop runs until their are no changes made) increases. This intuitively makes sense since the more means we have, the more possible opportunities for group assignment we have. \n",

Smaller/bigger values of k lead to bigger/smaller Voronoi cells. With more means being calculated, the time it takes for the program to terminate increases. However, these differences are mostly negligible aside from values of k > 30. "
