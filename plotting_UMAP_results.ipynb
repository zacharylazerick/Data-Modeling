Since this is such a common use case the umap package now includes utility routines to make plotting UMAP results simple, and provide a number of ways to view and diagnose the results. Rather than seeking to provide a comprehensive solution that covers all possible plotting needs this umap extension seeks to provide a simple to use interface to make the majority of plotting needs easy, and help provide sensible plotting choices wherever possible. To get started looking at the plotting options let's load a variety of data to work with."

    "\n",
    "Once you have a lot of data it becomes easier for a simple scatter plot to lie to you. Most notably overplotting, where markers for points overlap and pile up on top of each other, can deceive you into thinking that extremely dense clumps may only contain a few points. While there are things that can be done to help remedy this, such as reducing the point size, or adding an alpha channel, few are sufficient to be sure the plot isn't subtly lying to you in some way. This essay in the datashader documentation does an excellent job of describing the issues with overplotting, why the obvious solutions are not quite sufficient, and how to get around the problem. To make life easier for users the umap.plot package will automatically switch to using datashader for rendering once your dataset gets large enough. This helps to ensure you don't get fooled by overplotting. We can see this in action by working with one of the larger datasets such as Fashion-MNIST.\n",

    "For a different perspective we can look at approximations of the local dimension around each data point. Ideally the local dimension should match the embedding dimension (although this is often a lot to hope for. In practice when the local dimension is high this represents points (or areas of the space) that UMAP will have a harder time embedding as well. Thus one can trust the embedding to be more accurate in regions where the points have consistently lower local dimension."

    "As you can see, the local dimension of the data varies quite widely across the data. In particular the lower left cluster has the lowest local dimension -- this is actually unsurprising as this is the cluster corresponding to the digits 1: there are relatively few degrees of freedom over how a person draws a number one, and so the resulting local dimension is lower. In contrast the clusters in the middle have a much higher local dimension. We should expect the embedidng to be a little less accurate in these regions: it is hard to represent seven dimensional data well in only two dimensions, and compromises will need to be made.\n",

    "The final diagnostic we'll look at is how well local neighborhoods are preserved. We can measure this in terms of the Jaccard index of the local neighborhood in the high dimensional space compared to the equivalent neighborhood in the embedding. The Jaccard index is essentially the ratio of the number of neighbors that the two neighborhoods have in common over the total number of unique neighbors across the two neighborhoods. Higher values mean that the local neighborhood has been more accurately preserved.\n",

    "As one might expect the local neighborhood preservation tends to be a lot better for those points that had a lower local dimension (as seen in the last plot). There is also a tendency for the edges of clusters (where there were clear boundaries to be followed) to have a better preservation of neighborhoods than the centers of the clusters that had higher local dimension. Again, this provides a view on which areas of the embedding you can have greater trust in, and which r"
